## BC Coverage Check

All 42 BCs covered. See dependency-graph.md BC-to-Stories matrix for full traceability.

## Backlog / Deferred Stories

Stories created as concrete drift-item targets BEFORE they're scheduled into a wave.
Backlog stubs have minimal frontmatter and no ACs yet. When a wave-N planning cycle
picks one up, story-writer fleshes it out into a normal wave-N story (move out of this
section, add full ACs/tasks/files/architecture).

Backlog convention introduced 2026-06-24 per drbothen/vsdd-factory#260 rollback —
addresses the "deferred to TBD story" anti-pattern.

| Story ID | Title | Status | Drift items consumed | Earliest wave |
|----------|-------|--------|----------------------|---------------|
| S-BL.OA | outer-assembler — compose ChannelFrame + OuterHeader into wire frames | backlog | wave-adv F-001 (spec closed) / F-003 / F-004 | Wave 3+ |

## Files

All story files are in `.factory/stories/S-N.MM-*.md`. Backlog stubs use `.factory/stories/S-BL.*-*.md`. Epic files are in `.factory/stories/epics/E-N-*.md`.
