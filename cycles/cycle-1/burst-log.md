## Wave-1 Gate Burst 1 (2026-06-24)

**Agents dispatched:** product-owner, architect, state-manager
**Files touched:** HS-001 (v1.0→v1.1), VP-016/018/041/051 (→v1.1), STATE.md, wave-adversary + holdout reports
**Summary:** Wave-1 integration gate burst 1. PO patched HS-001 to v1.1 (sequence-semantics wording). Architect fixed VP-041/VP-016/VP-051 drift. State-manager persisted adversary + holdout reports.

| Agent | Task | Output |
|-------|------|--------|
| product-owner | HS-001 wording patch | commit `44f5bc3` — HS-001 v1.0→v1.1 |
| architect | VP drift fixes | commit `e8af50a` — VP-016/018/041/051 v1.1 |
| state-manager | persist reports | commit `1d2993a` — wave-adversary + holdout v1-FAIL reports |
| state-manager | STATE.md drift register | commit `b05880a` — wave-1 keys + Drift Register |

## Wave-1 Gate Burst 2 — HS-001 v1.1 re-eval (2026-06-24)

**Agents dispatched:** holdout-evaluator
**Files touched:** holdout-HS-001-evaluation-v2-PASS.md
**Summary:** Re-run holdout HS-001 against patched v1.1 scenario. Result: PASS (6/6, mean 1.00, critical-min 1.00).

| state-manager | un-close wave-1 gate | commit `(rollback)` |
| product-owner | BC-2.01.002 PC5 MTU + error-taxonomy E-FRM/E-PRT | commit `6c064d9` |
| architect | ARCH-09 time-package carve-out + BC-2.01.004 payload_len align | commit `345d4f4` |
| story-writer | S-1.01 File Structure add address_test.go | commit `345d4f4` |
| state-manager | persist burst A | commit `8b45a07` — backlog story S-BL.OA stub created |

## Wave-1 ROLLBACK Burst B — Refactor PR #3 (2026-06-24)

**Agents dispatched:** test-writer, implementer, adversary (×3), pr-manager, devops-engineer
**Files touched:** internal/frame/frame.go (FrameType named type, Valid(), ErrInvalidFrameType, MaxPayloadSize, ErrPayloadTooLarge), internal/halfchannel/halfchannel.go (ChannelFrame.FrameType cross-module), tests
**Summary:** Combined F-001+F-002 refactor. PR #3 squash-merged at 4be1b53 on develop. 3 adversary passes all clean (BC-5.39.001 satisfied). Closes F-001 (MTU contract) and F-002 (FrameType named type).

| Agent | Task | Output |
|-------|------|--------|
| test-writer | failing tests for FrameType + MTU | feature/refactor-frametype-mtu branch |
| implementer | TDD — typed FrameType + MTU validation | commit on feature branch |
| adversary ×3 | convergence passes | 0-0-0 clean (BC-5.39.001) |
| pr-manager | PR lifecycle | PR #3, merge `4be1b53` |
| devops-engineer | worktree cleanup | post-merge cleanup |
