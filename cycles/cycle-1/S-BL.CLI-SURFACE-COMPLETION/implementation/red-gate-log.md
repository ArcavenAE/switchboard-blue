# S-BL.CLI-SURFACE-COMPLETION — Red Gate Log

Story spec: `stories/S-BL.CLI-SURFACE-COMPLETION.md` (v2.6, converged v2.5 per
`.factory/cycles/cycle-1/S-BL.CLI-SURFACE-COMPLETION/adversary-convergence-state.json`).
Delivery worktree: `.worktrees/S-BL.CLI-SURFACE-COMPLETION` @
`feature/S-BL.CLI-SURFACE-COMPLETION`, branched from `develop` @ `4c276d9`.

Red Gate discipline per BC-5.38.001: stubs compile and pass registration
tests, then a failing test suite is written against those stubs before any
real implementation lands.

## Step 1 — Stubs (stub-architect)

**Commit:** `5d54af4` — `chore(cli-surface): S-BL.CLI-SURFACE-COMPLETION stubs — dispatch + wire skeleton (Red Gate)`

**Files:** 6 new, 5 modified (16 files changed, 386 insertions, 25 deletions).

New:
- `cmd/sbctl/paths_ping.go` — `runPathsPing` (AC-001..AC-004)
- `cmd/sbctl/router_reload.go` — `runRouterReload` (AC-015)
- `cmd/sbctl/router_drain.go` — `runRouterDrain` (AC-016)
- `cmd/sbctl/svtn.go` — `runSvtn`, `runSvtnStatus`, `runSvtnDestroyShim` (AC-005..AC-010)
- `cmd/switchboard/router_control_wire.go` — server-side control wiring
- `internal/mgmt/register_ping.go` — `RegisterPingHandler`

Modified:
- `cmd/sbctl/main.go`, `cmd/switchboard/main.go` — dispatch arms (paths
  `ping` sub-verb, router `reload`/`drain` sub-verbs, new top-level `svtn`
  case)
- `cmd/switchboard/metrics_wire.go`, `cmd/switchboard/admin_handlers.go`,
  `cmd/switchboard/mgmt_wire.go` — `runRouter` signature widened; 13 call
  sites across 6 files updated to match (per the pass-2 spec-adversarial
  enumeration)

**Stub discipline:** all new behavior bodies are `panic("not implemented: ...")`.
Registration outer-functions are real (not stubbed) so existing daemon tests
keep passing — same shape as the S-7.04-FU-PE-CONNECTOR precedent (`9d184db`).
Dispatch arms in `main.go` are real trivial routing, not stubs; only the
functions they call panic.

**Gates:** `go build` / `go vet` clean, `gofumpt` clean, `just lint` 0 issues.

**Two spec-intended pre-existing test regressions** surfaced at this step
(handler count 6→7; an orphan-svtn premise) — both resolved by step 2's
spec-driven test updates, not treated as stub-step defects.

## Step 2 — Failing tests (test-writer)

**Commits:** `8113b66` — `test(cli-surface): failing test suite for S-BL.CLI-SURFACE-COMPLETION — Red Gate`;
`5bdad28` (amendment) — `test(cli-surface): assert E-CFG-001 token in AC-008 missing-name subtest`.

**Files:** 4 new test files, 2 extended, 2 stale-premise updates, 1
fragile-coincidence hardening.

New: `cmd/sbctl/paths_ping_test.go`, `cmd/sbctl/router_control_test.go`,
`cmd/sbctl/svtn_test.go`, `cmd/switchboard/router_control_wire_test.go`.
Extended: `cmd/sbctl/main_test.go`, `cmd/switchboard/admin_handlers_test.go`.
Updated (stale premise / hardening): `cmd/sbctl/phase5_pass8_test.go`,
`cmd/switchboard/mgmt_wire_test.go`.

**Coverage:** 25 top-level failing test functions / 42 subtests, all
mapped to AC targets. All unrelated suites remain green. Race-clean.
`go build` / `go vet` / lint clean.

**ORCHESTRATOR-VERIFIED independently:** 25 failing tests confirmed at
`5bdad28`.

## Engineering note — cross-goroutine stub-panic hazard

Tests invoking a stub across a goroutine boundary (e.g. a subprocess-style
daemon dispatch) use subprocess re-exec (`runProductionMain` /
`runRouterControlScenario`) rather than a same-process `recover()`, since a
panic crossing goroutines in-process would crash the whole test binary and
take unrelated tests down with it. Same-goroutine, no-server unit-level
stub calls (e.g. `routerReloadRPCHandler`'s `configPath == ""` guard,
`admin.svtn.status`'s handler closure) use a local `recover()` wrapper
instead, since that is safe when the panic and the assertion happen on the
same goroutine. Anti-panic-trace assertions were added throughout to
prevent a stub panic from being misread as a false pass.

## Token audit

Every spec'd error-code token this story's own handlers emit has an
explicit assertion: `E-CFG-001`, `E-NET-001`, `E-ADM-010`, `E-CFG-004`,
`E-SVTN-003`, `E-ADM-009`, `E-RPC-010`. `E-CFG-008` and `E-CFG-011` appear
in the story only as cross-reference precedent shapes for other
`error-taxonomy.md` rows, not codes this story's handlers emit — correctly
left unasserted.

## Ambiguity adjudications (flagged for the step-4.5 adversary)

1. **AC-008/AC-010 error prose is unpinned by design.** Tests assert
   semantic substrings plus the spec'd `E-CFG-001` token rather than a
   byte-exact literal.
2. **`--router` override is unique to `paths ping`**, per BC-2.06.004 PC-1
   / the interface-definitions §77 adjudication; `reload`/`drain` use
   `--target` instead. This asymmetry is intentional, not an oversight.
3. **AC-012 PC-3 severance is tested via a defensible wire-level proxy**
   (drain fires, then a follow-up RPC confirms the server was not
   corrupted) rather than a full `runRouter`-daemon severance test, which
   is blocked on an ephemeral-key test seam that does not yet exist. The
   step-4.5 adversary should scrutinize this proxy specifically — it is
   the one test in this suite standing in for behavior it cannot fully
   exercise yet.

## Green Phase

**Implementation commits (implementer):**
- `99012b7` — AC-001..004 `paths.ping` (client + server)
- `84e0561` — AC-005..010 `admin.svtn.status` + `svtn` dispatch
- `70ea1f1` — AC-011..016 `router reload`/`router drain`

**Test-conflict fix (test-writer):** `409457d`.

**Test-suite conflict adjudicated mid-green:** `runTierOneAuthScenario`
passed `configPath=""` and collided with AC-011 PC-3's guard test on the
same handler. The implementer STOPPED per TDD discipline rather than
weaken the test. Orchestrator adjudicated fix-the-test: AC-014's own
premise is a production-reachable router, and the story's defense-in-depth
chain (`runRouter`'s `cfg==nil` guard + `main.go`'s `"router"` case)
guarantees `configPath != ""` for every production-reachable router — the
zero-value `configPath` in `runTierOneAuthScenario` was the test's premise
error, not a spec gap. Test-writer fixed at `409457d`, mirroring the
`reload_bridges_sighup` scenario's existing non-empty-`configPath`
pattern. Recorded here as a TDD-walls-working instance: the wall held,
the fix landed on the correct side of it.

**Latent bug found and fixed in scope:** `cmd/sbctl`'s `main()` never
called `os.Exit(0)` on success — invisible until this story's first
happy-path subprocess tests exercised it. One-line fix folded into
`99012b7`.

**Design note flagged for the step-4.5 adversary:** `paths ping` and
`admin.svtn.status` emit the JSON envelope unconditionally — AC-001 PC-4
specifies the JSON report with no `--json` gating, and the tests enforce
that. Whether this envelope-vs-bare-object convention is consistent with
sibling commands (which may gate JSON output behind a flag) is a step-4.5
check item, not resolved here.

Implementer notes from the spec-adversarial arc (N-CS-SP7-01 usage-hint
refresh, N-CS-SP9-01 help-string refresh) confirmed done in this pass.

**Final green evidence:** `go test -count=1 ./...` — all 25 packages
`ok` (orchestrator-verified), race-clean, `go vet` / `gofumpt` / lint all
clean.

## Step-4.5 pass 1

**Adversary:** adv-cs-i1, 2026-07-13. **Verdict:** HAS_FINDINGS, streak
0/3. **Diff reviewed:** `4c276d9..409457d`. Dispatch tuple — develop
`4c276d9`, feature `409457db843b824a88236978b8f3592b687f34a6`, factory
`aab243c` — POL-005 verified PASS by the adversary.

**F-CS-I1-001 (MED, coverage):** AC-004 had zero tests. The story-named
`TestWireMetricsHandlers_RegistersPingOnEveryMode` and
`TestPingHandler_EmptyArgsIn_PongOut_ZeroPathTrackerInteraction` were
never written in the Red suite — the Red inventory was complete against
itself but incomplete against the 16 ACs. Implementation was correct by
inspection; the gap was test coverage, not behavior.
Remediated at `1b0e010` (test-writer): `metrics_wire_test.go` +271,
`internal/mgmt/register_ping_test.go` +135 (new), 4 subtests including a
`go/ast` four-call-site static check and an `SVTNMetrics` tripwire spy.
Non-vacuity mutation-verified for every assertion (each mutation reverted
after confirming it failed as expected). Orchestrator-verified both tests
pass by name at `-count=1`.

**F-CS-I1-002 (LOW, convention):** `cmd/sbctl/paths_ping.go`'s
`--router`-requires-value branch stamped `E-CFG-010` (key-load code,
exit-1 taxonomy row) instead of `E-CFG-001` (client-side usage error,
exit 2) — wrong code, wrong exit-class pairing, inconsistent with the
sibling flag-validation branch in the same file.
Remediated at `4dad99e` (implementer): both occurrences corrected to
`E-CFG-001` (`"E-CFG-001: paths ping: --router requires a value"`); the
genuine key-load `E-CFG-010` use (`loadEd25519Key`) left untouched — that
one really is a key-load failure. Matches the Ruling 2 Addendum
client-side precedent. Orchestrator-verified.

**Sanctioned, no action:** N-CS-I1-01 (JSON-envelope divergence, same
item as the Green-phase design note), N-CS-I1-02 (AC prose
`--router`/`--target` asymmetry, cosmetic, already adjudicated
intentional), N-CS-I1-03 (no-dispatch assertion immaterial), N-CS-I1-04
(`os.Exit(0)` defer-skip harmless).

**Clean lenses:** existence-oracle byte-identical + no timing leak;
signal-coalescing semantics correct + race-clean; SIGTERM parity; test
honesty; all 3 Green-phase adjudications honored; the `409457d` test fix
verified exactly as narrow as described.

**Post-remediation:** feature head `1b0e010`, full suite 25 packages `ok`
at `-count=1`, race-clean (`cmd/switchboard`, `internal/mgmt`), lint 0
issues, gofumpt clean.

## Step-4.5 pass 2

**Adversary:** adv-cs-i2, 2026-07-13. **Verdict:** HAS_FINDINGS, streak
0/3. **Diff reviewed:** `4c276d9..1b0e010`. Dispatch tuple — develop
`4c276d935b089026fac4fa796612352374bb880f`, feature
`1b0e01048486cf07eed3fe728a4bfc1af1112a8a`, factory
`c37f5e17b3a852d133ecc20e1fbdc443927cdb24` — POL-005 verified PASS by the
adversary.

**F-CS-I2-001 (LOW, spec-governance, architect-owned — zero
implementation-code defects this pass):** Forward Obligation (b) was
unfulfilled at delivery. The ARCH-INDEX SS-06 row lacked `internal/mgmt`
despite BC-2.06.004's `architecture_module` citing it.
Remediated by the architect: ARCH-INDEX v1.9 → v1.10 (SS-06 gains
`internal/mgmt` (Wave 7), SS-07-style annotation).

**Nitpick dispositions:** N-CS-I2-01 TAKEN (story AC-015/016 `--router`
exemplars were wrong vs interface-definitions §82/83 — fixed in story
v2.7); N-CS-I2-02 SANCTIONED (`paths ping`/`svtn status` hardcode the
JSON envelope — deliberate design, no AC/spec mandates `--json` handling);
N-CS-I2-03 SANCTIONED (delivered test files retain Red-Gate-era header
comments — documentation-only; branch-freeze policy means no code churn
between impl passes; cleanup candidate at PR stage).

**Clean lenses:** 16/16 AC compliance (wire contracts byte-exact vs
interface-definitions §420-423; E-CFG-004 Variant 3 byte-exact 3-way
match; 14 `runRouter` call sites verified); test honesty STRONG
(subprocess isolation, AST four-call-site proof, tripwire spy, no
vacuous tests); taxonomy conformance PASS; security PASS (svtn existence
oracle CLOSED — byte-identical E-ADM-009 test); concurrency PASS
(coalescing correct); all 3 adjudications honored; POL-001/004/005
clean.

**Remediation burst (all factory-side; feature branch FROZEN at
`1b0e010` — pass 3 reviews identical code):**
- Architect: ARCH-INDEX v1.10 + BC-2.06.004 v1.3 → v1.4 (`VP-TBD-PING-A`/
  `VP-TBD-PING-B` → `VP-078`/`VP-079` minted per the VP-061/062
  precedent; new files `specs/verification-properties/VP-078.md` +
  `VP-079.md`; VP-INDEX v2.39 → v2.40) → **FO(d) DISCHARGED**.
- Product owner: `capabilities.md` v1.0 → v1.1 (CAP-029 minted — "On-demand
  reachability and round-trip-latency probe via sbctl", quality-observability,
  no PRD FR anchor, introduced by Ruling 1) + BC-2.06.004 v1.4 → v1.5
  (capability re-anchor CAP-022 → CAP-029, input-hash `9d4a662`) +
  BC-INDEX v3.4 → v3.5 → **FO(a) DISCHARGED** (architect recommendation
  + PO concurrence).
- Story-writer: story v2.6 → v2.7 (VP propagation, Forward Obligations
  table all four rows DISCHARGED, N-CS-I2-01 exemplar fix, input-hash
  `cbf07f7` → `d95ecfe`) + STORY-INDEX v4.92 → v4.93 (row 147 v2.7 + FO
  bracket).
- **Outcome: all four Forward Obligations now DISCHARGED.**

## Status

Red Gate COMPLETE. Green COMPLETE @ `409457d`. Step-4.5 pass 1
HAS_FINDINGS, remediated @ `1b0e010`. Step-4.5 pass 2 HAS_FINDINGS —
spec-governance only, zero code defects, remediated factory-side (all
four Forward Obligations DISCHARGED); feature branch frozen at
`1b0e010`; streak 0/3. Next: step-4.5 pass 3 (BC-5.39.001/BC-5.39.002,
diff range `4c276d9..1b0e010`, identical code to pass 2).
