| Phase 4 — Holdout Evaluation | COMPLETE | PASS_AT_THRESHOLD 0.85 (2026-07-02) |
| Phase 7 — Convergence | **CONVERGED** 2026-07-06 (human-approved with remediation) — fresh-context audit CONVERGENCE-CLEAN (0 critical, 11 findings ALL remediated: docs PR #107 2e0f926, ARCH b088e54, stubs ef16ed5, sweep 677380f); census zero cycle-blocking, all process-gaps dispositioned; 63/77 VPs proven + 14 justified-deferred with story anchors (S-BL.TESTENV covers 10, S-BL.BENCH 2, S-BL.DISCOVERY-WIRE 2). **CYCLE-1 CLOSED.** | evidence: cycles/cycle-1/phase-7/ |
| Phase 6 — Formal Hardening | **COMPLETE** 2026-07-06 — gate satisfied: 63/77 VPs PROVEN (locks + cited evidence), 14 justified-deferred (6 infra-partial + 8 blocked: testenv ×6, S-BL.BENCH ×2 — per-VP justifications in changelogs); fuzzers clean (5 targets, 53M+ combined execs, 0 crashes); security scan clean (CWE-triaged); mutation sampling 11/15 + 2 gaps closed + 1 proven-dead-code.

F-IP2-001 MED: post-Start SetFrameCallback mutation clause in Design Constraints was unimplemented; architect ruled Option b — guard itself cannot be made race-safe without a new sync primitive; panic and silent-ignore both rejected; clause downgraded to caller-responsibility; sole production caller provably correct. Spec-only remediation: story v1.23 Design Constraints rewording + FCL row 4. F-IP2-002 MED: F-IP1-001 remediation corrected story prose but left false "No routing import" attribution in test-file doc comment; test-writer fix commit c3fca02 (comment-only; gofmt/vet/test verified). F-IP2-003 LOW: ARCH-08 v2.11 had modified: frontmatter entry but no Changelog-table row; architect fixed in-place (row at :509, frontmatter untouched — completes v2.11, POL-001 parity). All 13 bars CONFIRMED by pass-2 adversary. Sprint-state v2.32→v2.33. |
| 2026-07-11 | **S-BL.PE-RECEIVE-LOOP per-story adversarial pass 1 REMEDIATED — F-IP1-001 MED (all 12 bars CONFIRMED; AC-002 go list -deps guard absent; false build-enforcement claim; note v1.19 Option a2 ruling; e397157 TestUpstreamdialImportPerimeter; story v1.22 + index v4.62); 1 forward obs (nil ForwardFunc); streak 0/3; sprint-state v2.32; next: pass 2** | completed | PASS-1 REMEDIATED. Dispatch: story v1.21 + note v1.18 + impl a23deae. Finding F-IP1-001 MED: all 12 implementation bars CONFIRMED in code; AC-002 promised go list -deps no-routing-import assertion was undelivered (test not written); "build MUST fail" enforcement claim factually wrong (upstreamdial→routing edge is acyclic; compiles cleanly). 1 forward observation: mgmt_wire nil ForwardFunc — correct for single-interface set; forward obligation on interface-set-widening story. Architect adjudication note v1.19: Option a2 standalone TestUpstreamdialImportPerimeter in connector_test.go (Options a1 inline/a3 depguard rejected). Test-writer remediation commit e397157 on story/s-bl-pe-receive-loop — test passes, full suite 27 pkgs + race + vet + gofmt clean. Story v1.22 + index v4.62 propagated. sprint-state v2.31→v2.32. |
| 2026-07-11 | **S-BL.PE-RECEIVE-LOOP GREEN complete @ a23deae (9 commits c316aed..a23deae); F-GP1-001 adjudicated (note v1.18, unconditional close held, BackoffParameters Phase-3 stamp fix); story v1.21 + index v4.61; sprint-state v2.31; next: per-story adversarial pass 1 (BC-5.39.001, streak 0/3)** | completed | GREEN complete. Stub c316aed → RED a3d5117 (12 tests + frame_test blast-radius sweep) → RED harness return→break fix ae2ea7d (test-writer; server goroutine return in inner read loop capped dialCount at 1; sweep-8 upstream candidate) → GREEN implementation e85c9df (ReadOuterFrame body) → 8e8296c (receive goroutine + bootstrap flip) → 5274cf1 (mgmt_wire DropCache/FrameArrivalHandler/SetFrameCallback) → F-GP1-001 adjudication 9c1b21d (unconditional close — EOF carve-out removed; TCP half-close hole confirmed empirically 3/3) → 75c5904 (BackoffParameters Phase-3 stamp fix: Mode-drop poll + 2-stamp redial gap) → a23deae (gofmt). Full suite + race + vet + gofmt all clean. F-GP1-001 outcome: implementer EOF carve-out deviation HELD (architect ruled Option b — TCP half-close: peer CloseWrite + ACKed keepalives = permanently read-dead conn, no reconnect trigger); predecessor TestConnector_BackoffParameters fixed (drain-step removal justified after 3/3 empirical failure, documented inline). Propagation: note v1.17→v1.18 + story v1.20→v1.21 + index v4.60→v4.61. sprint-state v2.30→v2.31. |
| 2026-07-11 | **S-BL.PE-RECEIVE-LOOP spec pass 24 CLEAN — CONVERGENCE PASS: 3/3 achieved; race timeline benign; certification checklist 6/6; SPEC CONVERGED; sprint-state v2.29** | completed | CLEAN — CONVERGENCE PASS. P1a handed-down race timeline traced BENIGN: accepted fires at TCP-accept step-4, receive goroutine spawns step-5, WriteFrame bytes TCP-buffer until unconditional read; scanForLine polls 2s/20ms (orchestrator re-confirmed poll loop on disk); false-pass impossible — E-FWD-001 only reachable via receive goroutine → frameFn → OnFrameArrival. P1b full cold read clean: production single-interface E-FWD-001 drop deliberate + F-SP11-003-scoped; per-reconnect join implementable within dialLoop. P1c convergence certification all six items PASS with fresh greps: (a) every AC ≥1 realizable named test; (b) FCL→task bijection complete; (c) every binding contract reflected; (d) all four spec-doc before-texts grep-matched verbatim on disk — orchestrator re-confirmed ARCH-02:74 + BC-2.01.004:61; (e) counts consistent 7/~12/12+pair; (f) zero live retracted text. POL pass. P3 keystone recipes (NoDuplicateSuppression byte-contract discriminator, ExitsOnReadError teardown pin) traced realizable. All 23 ledger items hold. SPEC CONVERGED 3/3 (passes 22/23/24). Final package: story v1.20 + note v1.17 + ruling v1.0 + index v4.60 @ develop 42baa8c. sprint-state v2.28→v2.29. |

Adjudicated at S-BL.ARQ-TX (PR #98): NOT triggered — E-FWD-001 is receive-side (split-horizon-blocked log in routing); arqsend is a send-side seam and its integration tests route to valid dst (no path exhaustion exercised). Re-anchored: live daemon egress/send-loop story (sustained-retransmit load is the re-confirmation vehicle). Full analysis: S-BL.ARQ-TX DELIVERY frontmatter `drift_dispositioned`. | architect/implementer | re-anchored: live-egress story |
| OBS-VP-BENCH | OBS | NARROWED 2026-07-06 — S-BL.BENCH merged PR #109 (cd67394): VP-041 PROVEN (locked v1.3, M1 evidence 1.080ms mean p99, 46% headroom); VP-042 adopted with lower-bound loopback evidence, lock gated on S-BL.TESTENV integration.

| WAVE-GATE-DISPATCH-INTEGRITY | HIGH | [process-gap] Perimeter-2 (wave-gate) adversary dispatch lacks HEAD-SHA verification tuple; adversary caught mismatch opportunistically; silent-false-green risk if less-thorough pass proceeds. FILED upstream 2026-07-02 as drbothen/vsdd-factory#448 (Batch 28) — row previously stale ("drafted"). Local mitigation remains target: pipeline-hardening cycle. | orchestrator | filed #448; local target: pipeline-hardening cycle |

Not blocking BC-5.39.001 closure. | orchestrator / spec-steward | open — drbothen/vsdd-factory POL-003 tooling backlog |
| DRIFT-HS006-DRAIN-CLI-MISSING | LOW | Adjudicated at S-7.04-FU-1 (PR #103): DEFERRED with justification — not trivially reachable via existing mgmt-RPC patterns (needs new mgmt-RPC verb + admin-boundary changes in adminboundary_control.go + cmd/sbctl). SIGTERM initiates the identical drain sequence per BC-2.09.002 signal-driven drain, so the ops path is intact. Re-anchor: ops-UX story if targeted-drain proves needed post S-7.04-FU-DRAIN-WIRE. | orchestrator | deferred (adjudicated PR #103) |

- Pass 39 Adv-B: NO_FINDINGS + 2 obs (O-P5P39-B-001 metadata_notes schema element disposition informational; O-P5P39-B-002 Current Phase Steps "5 rows" vs 4-row display — benign rolling-window). Anti-findings: 16. Novelty: LOW. **Twelfth consecutive Adv-B NO_FINDINGS pass (P28 → P39).**
- **BC-5.39.001 SATISFIED: 3 consecutive clean passes achieved (P37 clean 0→1/3; P38 clean 1→2/3; P39 clean 2→3/3).** Phase 5 exits to Phase 6.
- Three-pass Adv-A clean-streak: P37 → P38 → P39.
- O-P5P38-META-001 remediation confirmed effective: preflight verified via git-ref cat, reconciled on first attempt.
- Observations O-P5P39-A-001, O-P5P39-B-001, O-P5P39-B-002: all LOW severity, non-blocking, no remediation required.
- Persisted: P5-pass-39-Adv-A.md + P5-pass-39-Adv-B.md sidecars; STATE.md; sprint-state.yaml v1.68→v1.69; session-checkpoints.md (Burst 91 entry).

**Sidecar paths:** `P5-pass-39-Adv-A.md` (Burst 91) / `P5-pass-39-Adv-B.md` (Burst 91)
